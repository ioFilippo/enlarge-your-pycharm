# Sensitive Search (snippet)

Code showing how to make a minimal odoo sensitive search frontend field.

Code of this snippet is intended as a base example of how to develop a sensitive search field box:
it means an input search field returning a list of items that matches to substring just passed.

To test this functionality, this module depends on website_event. Infact it overrides website event page when no events
are set: there you can find the sensitive search input field and test it.
